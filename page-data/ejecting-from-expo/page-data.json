There are restrictions that come with all this convenience however, the main one is not being able to use any native libraries that are not already built into Expo.</p>\n<p>At this point you'll have to eject. Now, that does that mean? Effectively it's more flexibility and also more work for you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you'll have the build deploy, manage native dependencies yourself</li>\n<li>you can no longer use the Expo app the preview your code</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In order to eject, navigate to the root directory of your expo project and run:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"sh\"><pre class=\"language-sh\"><code class=\"language-sh\">expo eject</code></pre></div>\n<p>This will create <code class=\"language-text\">/ios</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">/android</code> directories with all the native code that Expo was managing for you. You can edit the code now, but you'll have to build and run your app yourself. You can reference the <a href=\"./setup-rn\">plain RN instructions</a> for getting set up on your device or emulator. Specifically, you'll now have to build the native bundle yourself, download Xcode and/or Android Studio and emulators/simulators.</p>\n<p>Read more about ejecting <a href=\"https://docs.expo.io/workflow/customizing/\">here</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/ejecting-from-expo","title":"[Expo] Ejecting from Expo","order":30}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"edges":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":0,"path":"/intro","title":"Welcome"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":1,"path":"/react-native","title":"About React Native"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":2,"path":"/the-expo-debate","title":"Should you use Expo or plain React Native?"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":3,"path":"/setup-expo","title":"[Expo] Getting started with Expo"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":4,"path":"/setup-rn","title":"[RN] Getting started with plain React Native"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":5,"path":"/code-style","title":"Adding a linter"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":6,"path":"/debugging","title":"Debugging"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":7,"path":"/intro-to-react","title":"Basic React Native components"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":8,"path":"/styling","title":"Styling"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":9,"path":"/styling-exercise","title":"Styling Exercise üìù"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":10,"path":"/styling-exercise-solution","title":"Styling Exercise Solution üëÄ"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":11,"path":"/components","title":"Components"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":12,"path":"/lists","title":"Lists"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":13,"path":"/lists-exercise","title":"Lists Exercise üìù"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":14,"path":"/lists-exercise-solution","title":"Lists Exercise Solution üëÄ"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":15,"path":"/navigation-intro","title":"Navigation Intro"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":16,"path":"/navigation-expo","title":"[Expo] Adding navigation with Expo"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":17,"path":"/navigation-rn","title":"[RN] Adding navigation with plain React Native"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":18,"path":"/adding-navigation","title":"Adding Navigation"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":19,"path":"/navigation-exercise","title":"Navigation Exercise üìù"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":20,"path":"/navigation-exercise-solution","title":"Navigation Exercise Solution üëÄ"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":21,"path":"/react-hooks","title":"useState, useCallback, useEffect"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":22,"path":"/network-requests-exercise","title":"Network Requests Exercise üìù"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":23,"path":"/network-requests-exercise-solution","title":"Network Requests Exercise Solution üëÄ"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":24,"path":"/pull-to-refresh","title":"Pull to refresh"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":25,"path":"/forms","title":"Overview of Forms in React Native"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":26,"path":"/modals","title":"Opening a full screen modal"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":27,"path":"/forms-exercise","title":"Form exercise üìù"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":28,"path":"/forms-exercise-solution","title":"Form exercise solution üëÄ"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":29,"path":"/wrapping-up","title":"Wrapping up"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":30,"path":"/ejecting-from-expo","title":"[Expo] Ejecting from Expo"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":31,"path":"/platform-specific-code","title":"Platform Specific Code"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":32,"path":"/security","title":"Security"}}}]}},"pageContext":{}},
